# Sentinel-2_CH
## Parameterfiles and tile numbers for processing Sentinel-2 and Landsat for Switzerland with FORCE.
Landsat images from 2014 until 2023 and Sentinel-2 images from 2017 until 2023 were processed to Level-2. The Landsat images from 2014 until 2021 were used as base image for coregistering the Sentinel-2 images. In addition, Sentinel-2 time series and quality-assessed images were processed. The parameter files were used within the prebuilt image pulled from Docker hub of FORCE. The FORCE versions 3.7.8-12 were used. 

## Additional information
The Landsat images were downloaded with landsatlinks (ernstste/landsatlinks).
